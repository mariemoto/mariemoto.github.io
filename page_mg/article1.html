               new Frappuccino is a trademark for a line of frozen coffee beverages sold by Starbucks. It consists of coffee or other base ingredient (e.g., strawberries and cream), blended with ice and other various ingredients, usually topped with whipped cream. Frappuccinos are also sold as bottled coffee beverages in stores and from vending machines.  
               <p>The Frappuccino is a portmanteau of frappe and cappuccino, an espresso coffee with frothed milk. The word was coined and trademarked in Boston, Massachusetts. In the Boston area, a "frappe" (pronounced "frap") is a term for a thick milkshake with ice cream, derived from the French word frappe'. The original Frappuccino beverage was developed, named, trademarked, and sold by George Howell's Eastern Massachusetts coffee shop chain, The Coffee Connection. When Starbucks purchased the Coffee Connection in 1994, they also gained the rights to use, make, market and sell the Frappuccino beverage. The beverage was introduced under the Starbucks name in 1995 and as of 2012, Starbucks had annual Frappuccinos sales of over $2 billion.</p>
            <p>Lately it seems like Starbucks really wants you to have a ton of options when it comes to Frappuccinos. There’s the new S’mores Frap, which comes with or without a cookie straw, and the beloved birthday cake Frap.

The latest in Frap news is not a new flavor, but a new size: a mini 10-ounce option. (For comparison’s sake, a “tall” size is 12 ounces.) The petite size will be available now through July 6, the Associated Press reports.

Starbucks began testing the new size — which we’ll now refer to as the Babyfrap — last September in select markets. A Starbucks spokesperson said the Babyfrap managed to attract new customers while also getting existing customers to return more often.

Mostly, we think people will go for it because it’s pretty cute. Look at it! </p>
                <p>Starbucks Japan uploaded a new video to its YouTube account on Monday, showcasing a fashion show the coffee corporation put on in celebration of its newest product, the “Fruits-on-top-yogurt-Frappuccino®.”

The “Fruits-on-top-yogurt-Frappuccino®” is made with a combination of nuts, yogurt and fruit, which the fashion show portrayed through various models dressed as the drink’s ingredients.

“Yogurt” was visually rendered through a smooth blue shirt and asymmetrical top with petal accents for texture; “crunched nuts” manifested in a simple taupe garment with dark brown geometric patches complete with walnut-inspired handbag; “fruits” designed as a hot pink dress with colorful paper fan attachments; and “cream” with a simple crop top and skirt combo created from a mix of creamy sheen and sheer fabrics. A final, unnamed dress appeared at the end, most likely implied as the Starbucks cup, where the ingredient models added their various outfit attachments to the “cup,” making the perfect frappuccino.

The outfits were crafted by Taro Horiuchi, a Tokyo designer who the 2012 Newcomer’s Prize at Mainichi Fashion Grand Prix Japan.
