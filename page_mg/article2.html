We're vulnerable in these moments and despite our best efforts, our actions seem to be more public than other times in our lives.

She just wanted to create my own art. Finally, in the summer of 2007, when the urge to be a full time artist was too strong. She took the leap and enrolled in San Francisco's Academy of Art University graduate program for fine art painting. </p>
